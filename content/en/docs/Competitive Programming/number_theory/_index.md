### What is Number Theory?
Number Theory is a branch of Mathematics that is devoted to the study of integers and integer-valued functions. It is of great importance in the field of competitive programming. Many problems in competitive programming are based on number theory and other related stuff.

### Resources to learn number theory for competitive programming
- [CodeNCode](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0zvY3yIBQTrSutsV-4yscQ/playlists) is YouTube channel run by [Waqar Ahmad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/waqar-ahmad-092b5a193/). If you are a beginner and want to learn number theory, you can visit his channel and watch his playlist on number theory [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRkqvQtm4DU&list=PL2q4fbVm1Ik4liHX78IRslXzUr8z5QxsG).

- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. If you want to judge your number theory skills, you can solve the problems from this site. It has around 700+ problems for you to solve.

- Enough reading here. Why don't you go and try it yourself.
